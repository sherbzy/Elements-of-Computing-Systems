2. 6-7 hours

3. I ended up spending a lot more time on the fill program than the multiplication program. The fill
   solution required me to start by writing thorough pseudocode to map out the program: I decided to
   use a small draw loop inside of the larger program loop that was used to color the entire screen.
   Once I separated my program into these smaller parts, it became much simpler.
