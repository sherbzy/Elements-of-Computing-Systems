Project 5
Overview and Instructions
Do project 5 from The Elements of Computing Systems - build Memory, CPU, and finally the Computer itself from elements you've built in previous projects.

The CPU is the most complex thing you have to build; the book gives you a significant head start on the design. It is a particularly challenging chip to build in part because testing it is non-trivial. Despite this, you may find benefit in building the chip incrementally by looking at the provided tests and seeing what needs to happen to satisfy each test in turn.

Grading
You will construct 3 components for this project. The Computer and Memory components are each worth 20 points. The CPU is worth 55 points. Partial credit is possible.

Task	Value
README	5 points
CPU	55 points
Memory	20 points
Computer	20 points
Total:	100 points

Include your name and the names of anyone who assisted you (other than the instructor). This is also a good place to indicate any other resources you found helpful.
How long did you spend on this assignment (an estimate is fine)?
Any other notes about the project, such as anything interesting you did in your solution, any "a ha" moments brought on by the assignment, etc.

3. The CPU was by far the most difficult of the three. I had a difficult time trying to figure out
   where to start when I was thinking through how to build the CPU. Originally, I wanted to start with
   incrementing the pc and outputting values (because that seemed easiest), but it turned out to be 
   difficult to do that without first loading values and performing calculations. I ended up writing
   pseudocode to help me get started with determining the instruction type and then was able to work
   forward from that point.
