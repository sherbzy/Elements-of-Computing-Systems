Project 2
Overview and Instructions
Do project 2 from The Elements of Computing Systems - use the gates you built in Project 1 to create adders, an incrementer, and finally an ALU. The ALU is significantly more complex than the gates you built in project 1; take it slow and work on it incrementally, testing as you go.

Grading
There are 5 gates, which will each be worth 19 points. The first 4 gates will be pass/fail according to the test scripts provided to you. Partial credit will be possible on the ALU.

Task	Value
README	5 points
Each (of 5) gates	19 points each
Total:	100 points
Submitting the Project
Submit a zip file on Canvas containing:

README
A directory containing your .hdl files
For hardware projects your solution only need consist of the .hdl files you created and your README. For simplicity, if you include other files such as .cmp or .tst files, that is fine, they will be ignored. I will test each of your gates separately against the built-in chip implementations, so a problem with one of your solutions will not cause problems with any of your other solutions.

README:

Include your name and the names of anyone who assisted you (other than the instructor). This is also a good place to indicate any other resources you found helpful.
How long did you spend on this assignment (an estimate is fine)?
Any other notes about the project, such as anything interesting you did in your solution, any "a ha" moments brought on by the assignment, etc.

3. The first four gates were definitely simple compared to building the ALU. The ALU seemed like a
very daunting task at first. However, I started by looking at the diagram in the book and writing
comments in to separate the ALU into smaller sections or tasks. This made the process of building the
ALU much easier to handle.
