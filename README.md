This repository contains the projects from the Elements of Computing Systems course at Colorado School of Mines taken in Spring 2022. The README in each folder contains the project requirements and other necessary information.

Note: The course follows this website - https://www.nand2tetris.org/

Course Description:
This course explores computers and their construction, starting with logic gates and working all the way up
through working software. You will start with the most rudimentary logic gates, building more and more
complex logic circuits culminating in a working 16-bit computer (in simulation). You will then build the tools
to implement software on this computer, including an assembler, virtual machine, and compiler. 
A brief list of topics:
 - Digital (combinational and sequential) logic
 - Computer architecture
 - Machine language and assembly language programming
 - Virtual machine architecture
 - Compilers
 - Operating Systems
In addition to the nuts and bolts of computers, we will talk about the history of computers, and engage in
class discussions ranging from technical to philosophical.
This class starts out with relatively straightforward projects designing digital logic circuits. Later projects
require substantial programming (in the language of your choice) and have been significantly more
challenging for most students in past iterations of this course. I am here to support you and cheer you on
as you tackle all of these projects!

Learning Outcomes:
At the completion of the course, you will be able to:
 - Construct basic and complex logic gates from simpler logic gates.
 - Understand the basic concepts of computer architecture.
 - Program in a rudimentary assembly language and implement software translating assembly into machine language.
 - Understand the role and design of a simple virtual machine and implement said machine.
 - Construct a working compiler for a simple object-oriented programming language.
